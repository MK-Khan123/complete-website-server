### `Project Features`

In this project, we were introduced to the idea of Payment Gateway (specifically Stripe Payment). We had the opportunity to explore MongoDB, Express.js (a framework for Node.js) a bit more elaborately. We used create, read, update and delete of CRUD operations in this project. The data displayed in our homepage is fetched from MongoDB but for some parts we used static data. We slightly used React Authentication along with our previous knowledge of React Routing. We used route parameter to fetch data dynamically from MongoDB and displayed accordingly. We applied Private Route (also known as Protected Route/ Authenticated Route) to restrict convenient access under certain conditions. In addition, we used plain bootstrap to make the website device responsive. Furthermore, we deployed our site on Firebase which can be accessed through the above mentioned link to experience the website.
